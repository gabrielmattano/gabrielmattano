- 👋 Hi, I’m @gabrielmattano
- 👀 I’m interested in working on frontend projects and mobile models including UX/UI projects. In fact, i want to know it all, even building systems from scratch.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Git, building an application to acces a database and controlling versions. I'm also learning how to build web pages to apply javascript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to choose a study trail, to get to know what can i do better and to focus on that specialization.
